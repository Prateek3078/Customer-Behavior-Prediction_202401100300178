# Customer Behavior Classification using Logistic Regression

This project focuses on classifying customer behavior based on purchasing patterns using logistic regression. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset containing customer purchase behavior indicators.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used (`customer_behavior.csv`) contains the following features:
- `total_spent`: Total amount spent by the customer
- `avg_purchase_value`: Average value per purchase
- `visits_per_month`: Number of store/site visits per month
- `buyer_type`: Target variable indicating the type of customer

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## ðŸ“Œ Steps Followed

### 1. Introduction
The objective is to analyze customer behavior and categorize buyers based on spending and visiting frequency. This is a basic classification problem aimed at understanding customer segmentation.

### 2. Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: The target column is label encoded. Features are scaled using `StandardScaler`.
- **Model Training**: Logistic Regression is used.
- **Evaluation**: Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, and recall are used to evaluate performance.

### 3. Code Highlights
```python
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
